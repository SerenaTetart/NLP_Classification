## General info
In this repository you'll learn how to classify text based on multiple models such as: Naive Baye, LSTM, Transformers (Bert) and One vs All

## Requirements

The basic libraries for machine learning and deep learning ðŸ˜ƒ

Libraries:
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Pytorch
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Transformers (Hugging face)
* Unidecode
* nltk

## Project 1 - SMS Spam detection

Using Naive Baye we have 97.72% accuracy ! (This is why companies use this algorithm for spams classification)

Using LSTM we have 97.72% accuracy, just like Naive Baye.

Using BERT we have 88.28% accuracy which is a bit lower than the other two.

## Project 2 - Fake news detection

## Project 3 - Toxic comments detection

For this last project I am using the dataset from kaggle: <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification'>Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification</a>

This project needs some changes in order to be perfect but we can already predict 'normal' and 'toxic' data very well.

Using Naive Baye we have for respectively normal and toxic data: 96.80% and 75.08% accuracy.

Using LSTM we have for respectively normal and toxic data: 83.11% and 84.15% accuracy.
